# Huddle-Landing-Page
I have created a project titled HUDDLE LANDING PAGE using HTML and CSS. Although the page is not yet responsive, this project has been a valuable learning experience for me, helping me deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS. It allowed me to practice structuring web pages and styling them to create an engaging landing page.
